# Genome-Alignment

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is used to arrange sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity. This alignment may indicate the functional, structural, evolutionary significance of the sequence. In this project, I will analyze gene and protein sequences of three  different organisms from Primates family using global and local pair-wise sequence alignments. Within the Primates family, I will compare sequence alignments of Human and Chimpanzee with the alignments of Human and Baboon. I expect that Chimpanzees will have more similarities in genes and proteins, and that the sequence alignments of Human and Chimpanzee will have high score and consist of more matches on the sequence alignments. I derive datasets from PFAM, KEGG GENES database and NCBI database to query specific gene and protein families that I wish to compare.
